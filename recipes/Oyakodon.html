            <h2>Oyakodon is a really easy, filling, and delicious traditional Japanese meal.</h2>
            <p>It consists of chicken sautéed and then cooked in a Japanese broth, and then finished 
                with egg and served over rice. It only takes 10 minutes to prep and 30 minutes to cook,
                leaving one satisfied with a savory filling meal in under an hour.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingrediants for four servings:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
                <li>1 onion, cut in half and sliced</li>
                <li>2 cups dashi stock, made with dashi powder</li>
                <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>4 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until 
                    beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until onion 
                    is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour in stock, then whisk in soy sauce, mirin, and brown sugar; stir until 
                    sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until slightly 
                    reduced, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl until well-beaten, then pour into the hot stock mixture. 
                    Cover the skillet, reduce the heat, and steam until egg is cooked, about 5 minutes. 
                    Remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Divide rice among 4 deep soup bowls and top with equal amounts of the soup mixture.</li>
            </ol>
